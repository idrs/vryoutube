=========

I have the luck to try the Oculus Rift for a while. I made this Youtube-Browser, that makes use of the VR abilities and hopefully creates a more immersive Youtube experience.

To do before opening
===========================
- Install Google Chrome
- Install the “npvr” plugin for google chrome (unfortunately it does only work for chrome right now :( )
Link: vr.js – npvr plugin
- Activate the plugin
- Start the chrome.exe with –args –disable-web-security
(Otherwise you would only see a black screen with 2 red dots. The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy stops the javascript code to get data from youtube.com)

Start
=====
Open indexYoutubeBrowser.webgl.html

Issues
======
- Youtube videos are not synchronized, this causes ghosting effects
- Youtube videos can not be paused etc. 
- The mouse doesn't work right
- ...
